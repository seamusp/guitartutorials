                <p>This website is designed for new and intermediate guitar players who are looking to improve their
                    playing abilities. If you are new to playing guitar, continue reading this page for more information
                    about how to get started, what you need, and advice when buying your first guitar. You can also use
                    the navigation bar at the top of this site to access more pages including chord charts, song tabs,

                <p>A good place to start when buying your first guitar is to decide whether you want an acoustic or
                    electric guitar. Electric guitars can create a much wider range of sounds using various amplifiers
                    and pedals, while acoustic guitars have a more familiar sound while also not having to rely on
                    electricity to function. Another factor that you might consider is your budget. If you're just
                    starting out, buying an electric guitar means you also have to shell out for an amplifier and cable,
                    which can add a lot to your overall price. Try browsing guitars from popular manufacturers like <a

                    and see if you can find something that suits you.</p>

                <p>The guitar is an incredibly versatile instrument, and it can be played in a multitude of different
                    styles. To name a few: folk, jazz, fingerstyle, percussive, and slide guitar all involve using
                    different techniques to create a unique sound on the guitar. When playing, you will usually either
                    be reading chords, or reading a tab. Chords are groups of notes that are strummed all at the same
                    time, while tabs involve rhythmically playing individual notes by picking one string at a time.</p>
